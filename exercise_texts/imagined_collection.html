Tales of an imagined collection

INTRODUCTION.  (cof, cof, ahem)

The collection that is the topic of this exhibition takes its name from an inscription in one of the main pieces, which shows an inscription that says: “Procesion from the metropolis to the necropolis, and back again, in the city, which is the world”. (Here pass slide 1)

These types of event were accompanied by writing and musical pieces. By the information depicted in one of the pieces we know the name of the piece accompanying this one. Titled “ Symphony of the Red Bird”, it is composed of three main movements, “andante, “ allegro” and presto, with to indications on which key to be played, Mi major and Mi minor, according to the suitability of the interpreters (and their instruments). A version with keynote of Fa has been suggested (project your voice, the room might be dark and dusty, so probably you don't know how many people is there, in the darkness. Speak loudly for them).

The pieces is by now lost (would they believe you on this?), so we just can imagine how it was by fragmented information recoiled here and there. The structure of the piece is at some moments resembling one of a fuga , sometimes a contrafuga, and sometimes the theme and the motive are not clearly defined, which betrays an origin of a not renowned second-tier author, relying in some well known, stereotyped formulas and tricks of the usual craftsmanship of the time (if you are near the projector and fill the heat, have a glass of water next to you).

Probably the product of a workshop ( like when we read that book about an old manuscript Shahnameh, edited by the Met museum: because they did not know the names of the hands, they name them author A, author B, C and so on), something corroborated in the uneven results that shows the use of hands of very diverse skill, since its discovery in a soon-to-be-demolished villa (like some villas here, from the seventies, lost in the desert? or like some villas in the avenida Arequipa, transformed into stores and divided over and over?), part of the private collection of a wealthy misanthropic owner, the group of pieces has had a diverse fortune, some pieces has been lost, other abandoned to the harshness of the urban development or teared in pieces for domestic use, without much care of the elements/or content; some even where repainted by other artists in the times of the Greater Depression (not to confuse with the Great Depression of 1929 - do we need to clarify this?). 

Some of the missed pieces were later reconstructed based on references found by few researchers, if that name can be applied to these re-collectors of information of the clandestine and the forgotten (on the dark alleys where abandoned books are sold? on the dusty abandoned rooms of a house? on a lost page on social media?), and some by the imagination of some sparse but enthusiastic fans, that, as writers that, with more passion than craft, take a romantic approach to the story of the discovery of these works. ( by this point some in the audience may be finding this tiresome; would you make a joke?, a non-partisan, sensitive one, of course).

The works can be-broadly-divided by the type of technique in which they were made: drawings, paintings and a group of work that makes use of different media, from collage to clay. The initial description of the collection goes as follows: nine canvases of middle size (between 1 and 1.5 width, almost squared) painted with acrylic on primed linen. 

For the explanation of the content of these works, there are two hypothesis taken by the specialists. Every entry of this dictionary* has different interpretations that mainly can be reduced to three choices by the reader. First, we start with the mere description of the subject the entry is about. We talk about its relation with other entries. (N. of E: this text looks incomplete. Please complete following the tone, style and topic.)
