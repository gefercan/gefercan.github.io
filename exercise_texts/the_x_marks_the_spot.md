 The X marks the spot

As in the old Indiana Jones movie, "the X marks the spot" (1) . Yes, this is the power of the mark, the trail, the sign that was, and still is, at the root of invention. Of the invention of writing, the making of maps, the record of a path traveled, ingenious human devices that used figures, drawings to evoke information, concepts, ideas to be passed to others. Indeed, what is in a mark, in such an image? a voyage, an endeavor, a calculation, a memory, a record, an evidence. A journey from intellection to perception and back. Diagrams, maps, charts, of many kinds had been from the very beginning linked to acquisition of knowledge, to the pursuit of science and consequently to the practice of epidemiology, as an efficient way of mapping out information, laying out ideas and hypothesis with the purpose of putting them to test.

It is therefore of no surprise that in the worst pandemic months in 2020 many academics and specialists recurred to this type of visual tools to make sense of what is happening. A daily cycle thrived where information came from different places giving affirmations and contradictions, creating above all, a conundrum full of informational noise (like in: is this like the flu? is this airborne, do mask work? do vaccines work? will be achive herd immmunity? when? what is long Covid? should we quarantine? how long? what will happen? will be live?). For dataviz practitioners, for sure, the names of Charles Snow and Florence Nightingale came to mind at the height of the crisis while the virus swapped entire continents. (2) (3).Tweets announcing the latest dataviz, exploring the evolution of deaths and cases, juggling around dates, projections , dates and places arrived day by day.(4)(5)

Data visualization, is a very sophisticated tool most of the times, and could be used either to explain and communicate and explain or to explore during research to obtain insights and understanding. The different uses are explained by Scott Berinato in his useful classification of charts using the criteria of their purpose and goal during different stages of the thinking process.(6)

An example of the detective, forensic work behind a dataviz is the well-known case of Dr Snow's map. John Snow (1813-1858) was a doctor in Victorian London, during the development of the Industrial Revolution. The city was growing and growing as it developed and people came to the city for jobs.  The growth in population and a poor infrastructure create the conditions for the spread of diseases like cholera. It was 1854. . Dr Snow, like a avant la lettre Sherlock Holmes started collecting clues to trace the location distribution of the cases in one neighbourhood and concluded that a water pump was at the center of the outbreak. This, it was assumed, should be because the water in the pump was contaminated. After more studies, it was decided that more hygienic measures were put in place and the cholera epidemic was subdued.(7) Cleanness saves lives. Not further in time-actually that very same year- during the Crimean War (1853-1856), a multifaceted social reformer, nurse and statistician who was in charge of the care of injured British soldiers during wartime, Florence Nightingale (1820-1910) looked forward to implementing more stringent measures of hygiene for the wounded, demonstrating that more casualties were from lack of hygiene than from the war itself. After the measures were implemented, the rate of deaths lowered dramatically. To show this, she developed a diagram to convince the government to implement these measures permanently. As we can see, the history of data visualization and epidemiology is linked from long ago. (8)

Dashboards. Seen in movies of all kinds being displayed in big screens or holographic projections, they are a universal symbol of information. One of the earlier, if not the earliest, takes on the issue of coronavirus was the John Hopkins University, tracing the path of the pandemic since its first appearance in Wuhan, China. In this case, they elaborate a dashboard map, showing all the related data. This set the path to the approach taking by many media outlets to track the spread of the pandemic. (9)(10)(11)

Flatten the curve. Curiously, one of the most distributed and shared graphics about the current situation was made years before. We are talking about the “flatten the curve” graphic, which research has traced back to 2007 and shows how the healthcare system can be impacted when the mitigation measures are not taken, and that has been brought back to the forefront by The Economist dataviz team among many others. (12)

The devil is in the detail. The emphasis is given to the analysis of the coronavirus The most serious people have taken the issue at hand especially since dataviz is about understanding-and we didn't understand very well what was happening. An example of which is the many graphic showing the difference between logarithmic vs linear scale ( plainly speaking, if I am not wrong, exponential growth scale traces the proportion of the growth, showing us if the pandemic, in this case, is still growing at the same pace (twice, thrice, etc), and to trace this Reuters is using in its reports a logarithmic scale, instead of a linear one. (13) (14))

By definition, maps are about space. Usually, you can organise the graphics either via a spatial organisation or a time-based organisation. To follow the complexity of this case, a custom approach was needed. The health map was an attempt to do so. Initially, it showed only quantities but in its current form also allows us to discern between new cases and previous cases through a timeline evolution.(15)

Yet, sometimes maps do not tell the whole story. Some countries or areas are smaller but demographically denser than others and therefore more relevant. How to graphic those details in the analysis?. This is sometimes tricky to show in a map. One approach is logarithmic vs exponential scale that we mentioned earlier. (16)

The focus was made in the statistics side of the epidemic and its growth, as the main evidence is mainly the number of cases and the number of cases, which are the number that is guiding the policies of governments across the world use of numbers (cumulative cases, current cases). There is a caveat, however, when using this for general information. Some of the maps were using cumulative information, which gives the idea that everything is getting worse and worse in an apocalyptical way. For media of massive reach, this has clear consequences as the public only receive this view and few will care between the difference between these numbers and the number of recovered people, deaths and new cases, all of which are hard to represent in a map at once. A word of caution has been raised by many specialists about the The availability of resources is signalled sometimes as a cursed blessing, like when Photoshop appeared and all the graphic design was shadows and 3d-rendered bevels.(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)

While the graphics we have seen are concerned mainly with the statistics and analytic side, others fulfill a communicational and social role, giving indications to the people of what they should do as in this graphic, and in this, they are a clear way to instruct the people on what they should and shouldn’t do. (22)

The discussion about the do and don'ts of visualization is full of specifics, details and important considerations which are of common use among the diverse range of specialist in the topic; most of them have been addressed from different angles and continuously and in the middle of the graphic frenzy, there have been improvements that will doubtlessly impact how data viz will be used in the future. It seems as many say nowadays, that data viz has become mainstream after all. Having seen all this, tan optimistic take is that undoubtedly the data viz community, whose practitioners are spread across many disciplines, from science to media, will obtain undoubtedly precious insights about how visualization helped or not to clarify, understand and communicate during this exceptional time. Looking forward to it. (23)
