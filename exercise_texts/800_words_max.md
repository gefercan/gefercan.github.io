The original question is why? and who? As in who-are-you-and-why-to-exist-if-you-are-gonna-die-anyway; the search for answers 
can lead to many places, some common, others, unexpected.

Sometimes it is so easy to disappear.

What holds you together is your point of view.

If there is nothing new under the sun, why do anything at all? Why add noise and redundant objects to the world? Apparently, for 
all this questioning, there is a small catch: nothing is new, yet nothing lasts forever, and who knows, maybe it has to be done 
again. Yet if you never bathe twice in the same flowing river, how can you rebuild something? And then, and only then, it is then 
that noise, joy and distortion appear, inevitable and welcomed.

In the game of inclusion/exclusion, hierarchies play along in the world, always based on different criteria. Power dynamics and 
relationships forge identities.

An individual can have multiple roles- perhaps in the same day- in every scenario, a different identity, all of them belonging 
to one point of reference: the own self. The world is a theatre of changing roles, a carnival and a game. Once in there, what 
holds you together is your (ever-changing) point of view.

OOP: Object-oriented practice. Images are catalysts for meanings. At least, that is how I see images, especially the ones 
I make, and I point this out because making, marking a signal, a trace-the line, the drawing, the video, the painting- as 
an attempt to register the existence, the will, is crucial to the impulse.

OTI: open-to-interpretation. Once finished, I wish for the images a long life and for that, I should not constrain them, 
as they are somehow open to interpretation; certainly, I can give the starting point of the how and why I made them.

AS IT IS: Yet, I confess, anecdotal emotions- joy, fear, melancholy.- remain very much the motor force behind my process.

Communication, such a drama.

Because of the original question, ideas like hybridity (who-are-you?) and ephemerality (when-are-you?) are present, one way or 
another, in most of my works.

For example, when describing the Latin American urban identity(Lima), use collage and Peruvian baroque references (from 
the Cuzco painting school, a translated style seen as an act of mimicry and sometimes wilful misreading and negotiation 
with the Western tradition in the shape of perspective, chiaroscuro and figure drawing). Or asking the prehispanic visual 
references (Mochica, Paracas, Nazca, Inca) what does it mean to be Peruvian, living in Lima/Dubai, in the 21st century?

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: other topics are the desolation of urban life (Lima), the artificiality of history painting 
(19th century), the disconcerted nostalgia of the migrant (Dubai).

From there, the work goes to the noise and randomness, but also a contradictory need for control. How do these urges dialogue?.

Ephemerality. Sometimes the very notion of historic references leads to this concept, sometimes is the material support 
of the work (paper, clay, cardboard boxes, collage), where only the record, only the documentation, the vestige, and the 
signal are witnesses to the process, to the action and the movement.

Hybridity and ephemerality affect the meaning of the piece (since not everyone has the same references to deal with the 
intentions of the work and interpretations change as you change). Hence, sometimes, the masks and goggles act as 
superstructures, a scaffolding of identities/faces- but also understanding(s) -through the eyes, since “seeing is believing”.

As the structure/system/city/imaginary world/theatre, designed to be in balance, seems unable to reach a clear definition 
by the imperfect set-up of one or more of its elements, the quest for meaning becomes more urgent. Scribbles, recycled 
cardboards, collages and screenshots come to the front as decorative, meaningless, irreplaceable human enterprises.

As the doctor advised: meaningless, polyphonic chaos. The image, a creative flow captured in a cage of light, colour and 
movement. Noise and randomness, but also, as said, a contradictory need for control. Sometimes it is so easy to disappear. 
What holds you together is your (never static) point of view.
